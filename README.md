The learning objectives for this project were to learn how to create a functioning web application that we
created from scratch. In this web aplication we learned to used Node.js, Mongoose, MondoDB and Moment.js.
Creating a detailed application came with its own challenges. Some of the challenges I encountered were minor 
like misplaced commas, simicolons, square brackets, or curly brackets. After compleating this application tutorial,
I have a better knowledge on how to create a functioning website that isn't just HTML and CSS.
